## How to install

You can install json2csv as a dependency using NPM.  
Requires **Node v10** or higher.

```sh
# Global so it can be called from anywhere
$ npm install -g json2csv
# or as a dependency of a project
$ npm install json2csv --save
```

Also, if you are loading json2csv directly to the browser you can pull it directly from the CDN.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/json2csv"></script>
```

By default, the above script will get the latest release of json2csv. You can also specify a specific version:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/json2csv@4.2.1"></script>
```
